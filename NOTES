This are my notes for my new program i am starting
            *************These are some python modules i need********************
            os.path.join(path, *paths):
            
            this module will join the paths on any system so they are seamless.
            Join one or more path components intelligently. The return value is 
            the concatenation of path and any members of *paths with exactly one 
            directory separator (os.sep) following each non-empty part except the 
            last, meaning that the result will only end in a separator if the last 
            part is empty. If a component is an absolute path, all previous components 
            are thrown away and joining continues from the absolute path component.

            os.path.walk(path, visit, arg):

            This one traverse the file system through all directories and sub
            directoris.Calls the function visit with arguments (arg, dirname, names) 
            for each directory in the directory tree rooted at path (including path 
            itself, if it is a directory). The argument dirname specifies the visited 
            directory, the argument names lists the files in the directory (gotten 
            from os.listdir(dirname)). The visit function may modify names to influence 
            the set of directories visited below dirname, e.g. to avoid visiting 
            certain parts of the tree. (The object referred to by names must be 
            modified in place, using del or slice assignment.)
